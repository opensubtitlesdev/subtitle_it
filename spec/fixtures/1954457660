          Just a few more.

00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:41,340
        No, no.  Sorry.

8
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:43,108
       That's all right.
 You've done more than enough.

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,845
    Okay.  All right, baby,
    see you later.  Bye-bye.

10
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:47,746
            - Wow.
            - Right?

11
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:50,816
  That's an impressive knowledge
  of the Marvel Universe.

            I know.

13

    Well, you've done it.
    You've finally found a woman

14
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,522
         I can do business with.

15
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,857
      Yeah, no, don't say
       things like that.

Moss, have you seen this

40
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:38,357
       video of the baby
       speaking French?

41
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:42,594
    It went viral at 10:30, Roy.
    Of course I've seen it.

42
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,963
        I must have been
         in the toilet.

43
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,431
Oh, Jen,
exciting news.

44
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,233
       I've just uploaded
       the second episode

45
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,369
       of my board games
          review show.

Care to have a look?

47
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,442
         That was fast.

48
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,178
   Seems like only yesterday

49
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,513
     we had to sit through
         the last one.

50
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,549
 It was three months ago, Jen.

51
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,317
            Really?
        It feels like--

52
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,719
it feels like it just happened.
    Roy, did you hear that?

53
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,389
       Moss has done his
 board game review show again.

54
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,324
     I'm not watching that.

55
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,760
  I'm not watching that again.
         Jesus Christ!

56
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:16,728
         We don't have
      to watch it, do we?

57
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,398
      We only sat through
  the first one the other day.

58
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,000
        It was three months ago.

59
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,303
         My God!  Wow.

60
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,638
         It feels like
         it just ended.

61
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,807
       It was so boring.

62
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,210
   It was like being insane.

63
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,213
It was so insanely boring.

64
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:36,281
                Roy's not a fan,

65
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,417
         but you said
         you liked it.

        Where'd you get
          your coffee?

        - Any good?

68
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:43,956
          Really good.

69
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,625
You specifically said,
and I quote,

00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,460
"You must show me
the next one, Moss."

       be over soon then.

00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,811

  that Alice is nuts about me.

  - Um, well, she said that...

     my feelings, you know?

     - Oh, she's rung out.
       Oh, sh--

85
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,735
     that keeps happening.

86
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:30,969
            All right, if I said
            I'd watch it,

87
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,772
      then I suppose that's what
      I'm going to have to do.

88
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,474
That's the spirit, Jen.

         Come on.
         Let's get it over with.

00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,477
Now, keep an open mind.

91
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,912
I know the first show
was a bit "bare bones,"

92
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,081

enjoy my new episode

    a strategic trading game

119
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,600
               Let's talk
               about components.

120
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,370
   Uh, shouldn't we do rules
       before components?

121
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,472
       I mean, components
      won't make any sense

122
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:15,440
          if we do it
       before the rules.

123
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,843
...Forget to cut this
conversation.

124
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:18,810
             What?

00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,879
Don't let
the actual progra--

126
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:26,418
   - How long is this?
   - Even hearing it is bad.

127
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,420
             I need
      to stop hearing it.

128
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:31,022
          Sorry, Moss.
       I-- I can't do it.
        It's unbearable.

129
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,925
     - Where are you going?
     - Oh, I'm jealous
       of your coffee.

130
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,194
 You literally can't watch it?

131
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,097
          I literally
        can't watch it.

132
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,866
       So what can we do
       to make it better?

133
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:45,871
     Well, I don't want to
    say anything that might
      hurt your feelings.

134
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,873
        It's all right.
      I can take it, Jen.

135
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:48,974
         I'm a big boy.

136
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:50,609
                 Well, as I say,

137
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,144
                   it's slow.
                   It's so slow.

138
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:55,213
Okay, good.  It's slow.
It is a bit slow.

139
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,415
   We can work on that, slow.

140
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,951
         I guess the other thing
         is that it's terrible.

141
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,153
         It's slow and terrible.

142
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:03,588
     - Yes.
     -<i> If a friend asked me</i>
     <i>  to describe it,</i>

143
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,724
  I'd say, "It's a slow terrible
  thing on the Internet.

144
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,793
          I could only
      watch for a minute."

145
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,060
        Is this helpful?

146
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,529
          Uh... pfft!

147
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:13,532
So helpful.
God!

148
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:14,199
Slow.

149
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:17,135
        Both: Terrible.
        Could only watch
        it for a minute.

150
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,970
  Well, a lot to get our teeth
    stuck into there, but--

151
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:22,007
- Well, let's see if I can help
  you with anything else.
- Oh, there's more?

152
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,209
       None of you were any good
       in front of a camera.

153
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:26,678
      - None of us.  Yeah.
      - You've got really
        annoying voices.

154
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,016
- The voices are a pain.
- And I guess that's because you
  haven't got<i> any</i> confidence.

155
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:34,586
    - No confidence.
    - I mean, if there's
      one thing you need...

156
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,922
     - It is confidence.
     - ...it's confidence.

157
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,890
Absolutely, well, Jen,

158
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,492
I can only thank you
once again for--

159
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:44,162
  - And another thing--
  - I'm not listening anymore!

160
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,800
       ( both laughing )

161
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,869
            Douglas,
            you're incorrigible.

162
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,103
I'm incorrigible?

163
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,171
You're Raymond Peterfellow,

164
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:57,576
owner of the finest lap-dancing
establishments in Soho.

165
00:07:57,578 --> 00:08:00,145
If anyone's incorrigible,
it's you,

166
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,514
you perfumed porno vampire.

167
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,915
          ( laughing )

168
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,117
    Perfumed porno vampire?
          I like that.

169
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:10,121
So you're thinking
of having 500 of these
travelling across London.

170
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:13,291
 - Raymond: That's what I said.
 - Sexy and classy,

171
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,760
and that's difficult
to pull off.

172
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,497
This'll get people talking,
all right.

173
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,665
Consider me
one happy shareholder.

174
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,266
                          Right.

175
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,602
       Oh, a big party coming up
       on Thursday night

176
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,237
     - if you're up for it.
     - Aww, damn.

177
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,038
    I'm supposed to be doing
     "Secret Millionaire."

178
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,109
      -- it!  I'll cancel.
    I'll tell my assistant.

179
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:32,944
          - Hi, Joan.
          - Jen.

180
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,312
    I'm not your assistant,
         Mr. Reynholm.

181
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,748
      I want you to cancel
  "Secret Millionaire" for me.

182
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,717
      Not your assistant,
   wouldn't know who to call.

183
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,685
       Just say anything.
     Work your usual magic.

184
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,255
              Jen:
      <i> Not your assistant.</i>
        <i> I am not your--</i>

185
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:46,525
         Oh, I'm sorry.
 I thought this was the toilet.

186
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:47,959
        Didn't this used
         to be toilets?

187
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,561
  Yes, I moved my office here

188
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,531
          to be closer
    to the ladies' toilets.

189
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,967
       I must get someone
    to take that sign down.

190
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,537
          What's wrong
        with you, Ross?

191
00:08:58,539 --> 00:08:59,671
A small mocha, please.

192
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:03,008
    - A small mocha, please.
    - Okeydokey.

193
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,746
           Or medium?

194
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,749
     Yeah, you know what?
     I've changed my mind.

195
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,050
  I think I'll have a medium.

196
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,319
               So you don't want
               a small one?

197
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,888
    Small is fine.

198
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,156
    Small is good.
    Just as good.

199
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:21,293
So I'll-- I'll just--
yes, that is what I will--

200
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:23,828
I'll have a small mocha,
my little man--

201
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,231
    my good man.
    ( mutters )

202
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:28,934
        Okay, coming up.

203
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:31,002
           ( irregular hissing )

204
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,941
         ( clattering )

205
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,280
         - ( grunts )
         - ( clatters )

206
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,384
       - Got it.  Yeah.
       - ( cup clatters )

207
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,753
     ( unsteadily pouring )

208
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,223
         ( splashing )

209
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,392
               ( clears throat )

210
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,927
                      Eh?

211
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,798
    ( mutters )

212
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,766
        Yup.

213
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,975
        Thank you for the virgin
        gin and tonic.

214
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,812
I suppose you could
just call it "tonic."

215
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,113
                      Yes.

216
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,850
So, Ross, how goes it
in the world of computers,

217
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,219
or PC world, if you will?

218
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,022
        We're all very happy.
        Thank you, Mr. Reynholm.

219
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:24,990
              Very happy indeed.

220
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:28,026
Forget this "we" malarkey.
I'm talking to you, Ross.

221
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,095
        - Are you happy?
        - Very happy.

222
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,129
           Thank you,
         Mr. Reynholm.

223
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,432
Look, I'm not your boss.
We're just a couple of guys.

224
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,301
A couple of guys
shooting the shit.

225
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,103
Now tell me the truth.

226
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,905
        Well, I suppose
    sometimes I do feel like

227
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,108
     - I lack
       a little confidence.
     - ( laughs )

228
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:49,781
 - I know, it's silly.
 - No, I've just realized
   what a funny voice you have.

229
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,318
    Now, Ross, I'm going
    to tell you something:

230
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,687
    Confidence is
    a confidence trick.

231
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:59,190
    Look at me.
    What do you see?

232
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,826
           A man who
     inherited his father's
      successful business.

233
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,062
  - It wasn't that successful.
  - It was pretty successful.

234
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:07,098
 - Well--
 - A lot more successful than
   it is now, that's for sure.

235
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,101
Yeah, all right, all right.
Just say the right thing.

236
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,703
    Say the thing
    I want you to say.

237
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:14,072
Say, "A confident man."
Just say, "A confident man."

238
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,841
  - A confident man!
  - I wasn't always this way.

239
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,843
There was a time
when I was just like you.

240
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,478
But then I discovered
the secret.

241
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,481
And, Ross,
I'm going to tell you
what that secret is.

242
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,450
But you must
keep it to yourself.

243
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:29,054
      I will take my ears
         to the grave.

244
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,391
    Two words.

245
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,161
    Women's slacks.

246
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,734
           I'm sorry?

247
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:45,036
    Women's slacks.

248
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,940
       - Women's slacks?
       - Yes.

249
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:52,811
    I'm wearing
    women's slacks.

250
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,047
        You're wearing
        women's slacks?

251
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,282
          Yes.

252
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,322
    That's nothing like what
I thought you were going to say.

253
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,757
          - Is it not?
          - It is not.

254
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,894
  I thought you were going to
 give me a book recommendation
         or something.

255
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,098
    ( laughs )
    Book recommendation?

256
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,299
I can't read.

257
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,101
Yeah, I don't know
what it is,

258
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,803
but women's slacks
give me the confidence I need

259
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,105
to survive
in a tough business world.

260
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:24,075
They're lighter, airier
and less constrictive
than men's trousers.

261
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:28,313
      And I'm pretty sure
      it doesn't make me
      a transvestite.

262
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,850
    <i> ( theme music playing )</i>

263
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,089
    <i> ( theme music playing )</i>

264
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,191
       Look at that shit.
          Look at it.

265
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,127
           I can't--
   how am I supposed to dri--

266
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,996
         it looks like
    he milked a cow over it.

267
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,531
           Gosh, you're so fussy
           about coffee.

268
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,566
     - It's very annoying.
     - It's ruined.

269
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:52,203
- He ruined my coffee.
- Don't just chuck it like that.

270
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,205
That fella shouldn't
be allowed to be a barista.

271
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,975
 - Why not?
 - Because he's too small, Jen.

272
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,844
     He's clearly too small
        to be a barista.

273
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,412
   ( sucks in through teeth )

274
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,847
             What?

275
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,785
       You're being a bit
 of a small-person racist, Roy.

276
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,487
     A small-person racist?
      That's not a thing.

277
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,157
         You can't have
      tiny baristas, Jen.

278
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,360
        For God's sake,
   the man works with steam.

279
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,862
     I'm gonna have to have
        a word with him.

280
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,565
         You-- you will have a--
         have a word with him?

281
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:21,833
That's right.

282
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,868
               About his height?

283
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,171
    I think he'd appreciate
         the feedback.

284
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,338
               About his height?

285
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,241
                 That's not what
                 people do, Roy.

286
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:33,378
Well, I'm not people, Jen,
and I think that's a good thing.

287
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,814
I'm not afraid to cut
through the bullshit.

288
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:39,417
   I bet this is exactly what
    Alice was talking about.

289
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,485
           Autistic!

290
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,454
     She said, "Autistic."
     That's what happened.

291
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:46,291
         No, I don't--
       I don't think so.

00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:49,594

           no<i> artistic</i> spectrum.

293
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:52,330
      But she said I was--

294
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,533
             Did she say it
             during an argument,
             by any chance?

295
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,635
         She did say it
          during an--

296
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,270
       - She did say it--
       - Ah.

297
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,438
    You know what was weird

298
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,640
       was we were having
     quite a big argument,

299
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:03,975
       and then suddenly
        out of nowhere,

300
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,945
    - she paid me
      that lovely compliment.

         Oh.  Oh, good.
           Good, yes.

304
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,556
          Sure, yeah,
          I'd love to.

305
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:22,594
       Yes.  Okay, well,
      I'll see you there.

306
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,463
          What?  Why?

307
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,165
          No, I just--

308
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:30,468
         Hello?  Alice?

309
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,239
       - That was weird.
       - What?

310
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:37,141
           Okay, so--
     what the hell is that?

311
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,210
        So she tells me
   that her grandfather died,

312
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,511
       she wants me to go
        to the funeral.

  I say that I'd be delighted

314
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,182
  and then she hangs up on me.

315
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:45,917
   Her grandfather's funeral?

316
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,252
 -<i> Yeah.</i>
 - That-- that's what you were

317
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:48,987
- just talking about just there.
- That's right.

318
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:52,657
          You sounded like
          you were being invited
          to Glastonbury.

319
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:57,695
    Ohh.  Funerals are sad.

320
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,564
          You did not sound sad.

321
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,566
   - I wasn't concentrating.
   - Emotionally artistic?

322
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,235
  You're emotionally colorblind,
  that's what you are.

323
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,504
    Maybe-- well, maybe I am
    emotionally colorblind.

324
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,306
    I was about to confront
        that little man.

325
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:11,175
   -<i> I know.</i>
   - I was going to give him
     shit about his height.

        I'm glad you realize now

327
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,545
     - how inappropriate
       that would've been.
     - Yeah.

328
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:18,483
 - ( keyboard clicking )
 - I'll just leave him a note.

00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,753
Small people
are not a race!

426
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,589
This isn't
"Game of Thrones"!

427
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:03,661
     They're actually calling me
     a bitch on the news.

428
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,062
What the hell
happened there?!

429
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,564
            How did you
            find out it was us?

430
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:10,268
  It's all here in the weekly
      surveillance report.

431
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:11,869
     What's going on, Joan?

432
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,738
        I expect better
       from my assistant.

433
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,940
    I'm not your assistant.
      My name isn't Joan.

434
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,541
       And what your beef
       with the homeless?

435
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,744
       I don't have
       any homeless beef.

436
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:22,680
       Ah!  So it's women
           you hate.

437
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:23,748
  Well, that I can understand.

438
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:28,452
Whoa whoa.
You record our emails
and tape our phone calls?

439
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,521
All right,
dry your eyes, Bono.

440
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:33,557
   If you've nothing to hide,
    you've nothing to fear.

441
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,925
      It wasn't my fault,
      Mr. Reynholm.

442
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,862
   I would never throw coffee
     over a homeless woman.

443
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:40,498
    And I would never abuse
        a small person.

444
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,468
  Certainly not enough to make
    a van with tits hit him.

445
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,438
       Although I suppose
         I sort of did.

446
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,475
 - I sort of did my one too.
 - It's frustrating that we did
   both of our things.

447
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,678
     - Yes, it is.  It is.
     -<i> All right!</i>

448
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,813
Spare me.
I was young once,

449
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,049
but if this gets out,
this could deeply damage

450
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:02,453
Reynholm Industries'
ability to make that
product that we make.

451
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,322
            What do you want us
            to do, Mr. Reynholm?

452
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:07,591
Don't do anything.
Stay out of trouble.

453
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,393
And remember...

454
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:11,529
           there are
        places lower...

455
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:14,565
         ( deep voice )
       than the basement.

456
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:23,407
      Stop worrying, Jen.
     Nobody can make us out
         in that video.

457
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:25,710
  It's just like early footage
       of happy-slapping.

458
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:27,445
        - Just relax.
        -<i> I can't relax.</i>

459
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:28,946
         It's all right for you.
         I have plans.

460
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:33,117
 I want to get up there.
 I will not be a social piranha.

461
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,885
          A what now?

462
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,954
     - Hey, Jen,
       take a look at this.
     - What is it?

463
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,522
    It's the new look
    "Game Board."

464
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:43,060
- 200,000 views?
- I know.  It's a bit different.

465
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:45,429
        - ( clicks )
        - ( explosion )

466
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:46,897
         Check it out--
         "Game Board"

467
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:49,867
   - Shut the fridge, it's...
   - "Game Board."

468
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,169
        -- "Game Board."

469
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,141
           Say what?

470
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,681
              Wow!  You all seem
              different somehow.

471
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:06,917
     Yes, we're all wearing
       women's trousers.

472
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,854
                    Oh.  Right.

473
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:13,090
     Hey, what's going on?
   It's "G-G-G--Game Board."

474
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,893
       - He's...
       - Newton Sinclair.

475
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,762
        - This guy's...
        - Roger Booth.

476
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:21,031
          And I guess
     I'm still Morris Moss.

477
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,701
        Are you wearing
       the trousers now?

478
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,703
I couldn't wear them
all the time, Jen,

479
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:26,737
    I'd have
    a heart attack.

480
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:31,175
No, they're safely
locked away in my
Fortress of Solitude.

481
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:32,877
     You know, it's funny.

482
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:35,413
       When I wear them,
         I'm a dynamo,

483
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,647
    a young Leonard Kravitz.

484
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,449
        People hang off
         my every word.

485
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,451
        And then as soon
      as I take them off,

486
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:41,819
         I'm just back
      to being the same--

487
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:44,088
    she's gone, hasn't she?
    She's-- she's gone.

488
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,090
 - She went quite a while ago.
 -<i> Yeah.  Oh!</i>

489
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,092
     Michael Bublé's here!

490
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,094
  No no, it's a funeral, Moss.

491
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:53,597
  I have to go to this funeral
    for Alice's grandfather.

492
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,199
          And I'm not
     looking forward to it.

493
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:58,035
          Funerals are
      a pain in the crack.

494
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:01,705
Even in the best
of circumstances,
they're no picnic.

495
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,674
But now I've got
Alice on my ass

496
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,509
like the emotion police.

497
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:09,180
So I'm gonna have
to look convincingly sad

498
00:24:09,182 --> 00:24:12,683
 - for the majority of the day.
 - Ugh!

499
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,119
She's not going
to expect me to cry, is she?

500
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,721
      - No.
      - What if she does?

501
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:20,157
I can't cry on cue!
What do I do then?!

502
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,059
            Do what I do
            when I need to cry--

503
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:25,129
          use a mild
          pepper spray solution.

504
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:26,831
Now that makes sense.

505
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:31,035
See?  That makes more sense
than having to feel something.

506
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:32,503
Do you have
any of that stuff here?

507
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:35,105
          Why do you think
          we have a mini fridge?

508
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,741
                   Good evening.

509
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,880
- You're got quite a lot of it.
- I suppose I have made
  quite a lot of it.

510
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:47,017
 - And what's in here?
 - Just Tabasco, wasabi and...

511
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,086
              a bit of tear gas.

512
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:51,989
Those sound like bad things
to put in your eyes.

513
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,593
            It's<i> extremely</i> mild.
            It's mainly water.

514
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:57,061
Okay, I'll take it
as a last resort...

515
00:24:57,063 --> 00:25:00,231
  - As a last resort.
  - ...in case I find myself
    out of my emotional depth.

516
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:02,900
   - There you go.
   - All right, thanks, Moss.

517
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:04,869
             - Bye!
             - Bye.

518
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:11,509
       Oh, don't forget
       to<i> add</i> the water.

519
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,546
    <i> ( theme music playing )</i>

520
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,186
    <i> ( theme music playing )</i>

521
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,655

522
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:27,091
     ( whispering, crying )

523
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,064
            Oh, poor Pip Pop.

524
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:36,100
    Sorry, what?

525
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,167
                   Pip Pop.

526
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:40,971
    We always called him Pip Pop
    because he was so short.

527
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:44,608
       - I see.
       - All of my family
         on that side

528
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,979
      - are really short.
      - Is that right?

529
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:58,355
        Oh.  Oh, Alice.

530
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:00,724
         - Shh.
         - ( sniffles )

531
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,902
   - Oh!
   - Roy, are you all right?

532
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,138
     Oh.  Yeah, it just...

533
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,105
         really hurts.

534
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,373
         - Oh, Roy.
         - Oh, it hurts

535
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:20,077
   - way more than I thought
     it was going to.
   - I know, I know.

536
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,980
          ( mutters )
            ...hell.

537
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:24,949
              Oh.

538
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,655
     ( sputters )

539
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,992
          Oh, Christ,
     why is this happening?

540
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:39,797
 Woman:
<i> So will we ever find out</i>
<i> just who this person was?</i>

541
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,799
              Man:
         <i> Unfortunately</i>
   <i> with current technology,</i>

542
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:43,200
      <i> we can't depixelate</i>
         <i> the picture,</i>

543
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:45,002
     <i> so it's very unlikely</i>
      <i> we'll ever find out</i>

544
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:47,972
         <i> the identity</i>
 <i> of this dreadful ginger cow.</i>

545
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,176
          ( mumbles )

546
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:54,878
  - What the--
  - Oh, are you still crying?

547
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,246
          I don't seem
      to be able to stop.

548
00:26:56,248 --> 00:27:01,318
   - What's happening now?
   - One of the pallbearers
     wasn't able to make it.

549
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,320
    - Oh.
    - Look, I know this is--

550
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:06,824
this is a bit weird.
Do you mind stepping in?

551
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:08,692
      - No, I'm happy to.
      - Oh, thank you.

552
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:09,860
             I mean
      I'm sadly happy to.

553
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:12,863
      - It's for Pip Pop.
      - That's fine.

554
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,799
Hi, thanks so much
for helping us out.

555
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,435
          No problemo.
        Hey.  Hi there.

556
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:20,771
             Hello.
    Oh, there's another one.

557
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:22,239
         Hi.  Are these
     the other pallbearers?

558
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:26,010
     - Yeah.
     - Oh, God.
       So you guys and me,

559
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,012
       we're gonna carry
      the coffin together.

560
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:34,385
 - Yes.
 - We're gonna put the casket
   on our collective shoulders

561
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:36,320
            and walk
  in a straight line with it.

562
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,756
  No, it didn't go well, Jen.
   It didn't go well at all.

563
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:42,026
  I mean, thanks for asking,
  but no, it's wasn't a success.

564
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:44,828
    This wasn't
    a successful funeral for me.

565
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,699
Didn't have
the required gravitas?

566
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,768
               Gravitas?  No no.

567
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,236
     Wasn't very dignified.

568
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:54,438
      It wasn't dignified
          at all, Jen!

569
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,341
        If I had to pick
       a word to describe

570
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:00,411
    Pip Pop's final journey
         to the grave,

571
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:02,913
      it would be "funny."

572
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:05,416
     It was so funny, Jen.

573
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:07,418
         And of course
      I tried not to laugh

574
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,153

    other things in my head,

575
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:10,688

          that we took

 how funny the whole thing was!

    How am I finding it so far?
    Well, to be honest with you,

703
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:10,474
       it's not as god-awful
       as I thought it would be.

704
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:12,175
             The people have
             been terribly nice.

705
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:13,276
                They're actually
                quite clean.

706
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:16,813
        And I have been invited
        to a party this evening.

707
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,582
         The last party
     I think I ever went to

708
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:21,384
   was when Elton John's dog
          had a baby.

709
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:25,489
  -<i> ( techno music playing )</i>
  - ( chattering )

710
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:26,490
Douglas:
No, I tell a lie.

711
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:30,861
The last party I went to
was when Conrad Black
got arrested.

712
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:33,196
                   Conrad Black?
                   Who's that?

713
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:34,431
          Oh, no one,
      just an old friend.

714
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:37,501
     - Let's get in there.
     - Yeah, sure.

715
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:46,209
           So I thought
           with Game Board's
           increased viewership,

716
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:49,279
            perhaps it would be
            a good place to put
            my side of the story

717
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:51,648
      and show the world
      I'm not the monster

718
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,151
         I'm currently
        supposed to be.

719
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,685
           Boo!  Boo!

720
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:56,887
          Could you
          not boo me, please?

721
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:59,756
             And that is
             a horrible T-shirt.

722
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,160
        So the question
       everyone's asking:

723
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,262
          Jen Barber,
       do you hate women?

724
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:06,630
            Oh. ( laughs )

725
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:08,465
    - Thank you, Jen Barber.
    - No no no.

726
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:12,335
Coming up, what was it like
to be a 14th-century
grain merchant?

727
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,870
        Wait, Moss, I don't know
        if that was clear.

728
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,238
          Sorry, Jen,
      it's these trousers.

729
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,240
    They keep making me want
  to move on to the next item.

730
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:19,543
   It's better broadcasting,
    and the slacks know it.

731
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:20,911
     - But can I just say--
     - Coming up--

732
00:36:20,913 --> 00:36:22,812
    - Will you stop saying,
      "Coming up"?
    - Next up--

733
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:24,781
             I don't know
             if I made my point!

734
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:27,817
                  ( screams )

735
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:30,554
             Oh!  Oh, my God.

736
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:33,323
        Richmond,
        do you work here or not?

737
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,825
    Well, I don't get paid,
     but I like to come in.

738
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:39,729
   Oh, so that "Goth2Boss" thing
   didn't work out?

739
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,532
          Does it look
      like it worked out?

740
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,467
        Anyway, how have
         you guys been?

741
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:46,803
             Oh, everyone thinks
             I'm a misogynist.

742
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:49,773
     Roy lost
     his girlfriend because
     he's emotionally colorblind

743
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:54,344
    and Moss is wearing trousers
    that make him good at telly.

744
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:55,712
        Any gossip?

745
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,681
       So what's going on
           with you?

746
00:36:57,683 --> 00:37:01,284
Oh, you know, keeping busy,
voiceover work mainly.

747
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,720
            Really?
            How did that happen?

748
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:07,224
Someone just noticed
I had a beautiful voice.

749
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:12,829
                   Oh, Richmond,

750
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,798
             things aren't going
             well at all.

751
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,433
Well, just get in there.

752
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:19,002
     It's just not the same
 when you guys aren't together.

753
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:22,239
Anyway, if you want me,
you know where I am.

754
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,042
                 I don't though,
                 Richmond.

755
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:28,912
          Don't lurk!

756
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,847
                Where did he go?

757
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,717
       Where did who go?

758
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:38,922
    Does it ever seem to you

759
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,458
      that the things that
          happen to us

760
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,593
         are sort of...

761
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,861
            strange?

762
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:47,030
                    How so, Roy?

763
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:48,531
            Well...

764
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:52,302
      remember when I had
   to pretend to be disabled,

765
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:54,070
         and I ended up
         in Manchester?

766
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:56,873
      That wasn't a normal
    thing to happen, was it?

767
00:37:56,875 --> 00:38:02,479
      Or when you ended up
       spending the night
    in that arcade machine.

768
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:03,480
         That was odd.

769
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:07,751
           Yeah, I suppose those
           were unusual events.

770
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:08,785
      And this is strange.

771
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,855
     What's happening to us
     right now is strange,
           isn't it?

772
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:14,057
         Well, at least
    it'll all be over soon.

773
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:17,394
        Douglas is bound
 to fire us when he gets back.

774
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:19,829
              Oh, come on, guys.
              This isn't us.

775
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:21,831
           Are we just gonna
           sit here and take it?

776
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,700
     What do we normally do
   when we get into a scrape?

777
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:25,035
        We normally make things
        worse and worse

778
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:27,037
      - and then it ends.
      - No, we don't.
        We stick together.

779
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,807
 - That doesn't sound like us.
 - I don't know where you're
   getting that from.

780
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,342
                     Come on.
                     Who are we?

781
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:34,711
             Who are we?  I want
             to hear you say it.

782
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:35,578
We're the...

783
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,380
   - IT Department.
   - We're the IT Department.

784
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:39,649
  You're goddamn right we are.

785
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:42,419
       - Are you wearing
         women's slacks?
       - Yes, I am.

786
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:44,688
        This is exactly
    what I'm talking about.

787
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,590

789
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:59,602
      Let's get into a car
       and cruise around.

790
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,338
   How do we get into a car?

791
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,639
        Smash a window.

792
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:03,873
                    <i> Great idea.</i>

793
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,442
                    Yes.

794
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:06,609
        That's the one.

795
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:11,948
       I'm such an idiot.
     I've got a robot hand!

796
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,987
Hang on a second.
This is my car.

802
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,145
Wow-wow-wow.
It's all right.

803
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:44,881
Everyone be cool.
I'll handle this.

804
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,383
Take that.

805
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:04,401
    It's all right, officer.
I'm doing "Secret Millionaire."

               come on, people.

807
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:08,805
               Come on, come on.
               What's going on?

808
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:10,440
               Come on, come on.
               Come on, people.

           wearing the trousers?

810
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:13,209
He won't take them off.

811
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:14,978
          Okay, okay.
   Come on, come on, come on.

812
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,212
                What's going on?
                What's going on?

813
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:17,847
We don't know
what's happening, Moss.

814
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,849
             To every problem
             there's a solution.

815
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:21,618
        What's our problem here?
        What's our problem?

816
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,721
   Everyone thinks I'm a cow
        who hates women.

817
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:27,123
             You're a cow.
             That's right.

818
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,859
              A terrible cow.
              Women.

819
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:31,428
               Okay.
               Roy, hurt me.

820
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,831
            Um, the woman I love
            thinks that I hate
            small people.

821
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:36,800
                 Small people.
                 Thank you, Roy.

822
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:38,201
          I'm probably
       going to die alone

823
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:39,969
          in front of
     computer pornography.

824
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,871
                  I'll just draw
                  a sad face.

825
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:44,073
Roy:<i> Sure.</i>

826
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:50,113
             Okay.
        So what do women

827
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,182
      and small people...

828
00:40:52,184 --> 00:40:53,950
           both like?
    What do they both like?

829
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,819
                 Moss:<i> What do</i>
                <i> they both like?</i>

830
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:57,854
           - Chairs?
           - Films?

831
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,923
            I really don't know.

832
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:00,824
                  I'll tell you.

833
00:41:00,826 --> 00:41:02,459
        It's just they seem like
        very different groups.

834
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,927
They're very different groups.

835
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:06,529
     "Not being attacked."

836
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:13,603
         They both love
      not being attacked.

837
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:16,206
Well, I can't speak
for small people obviously,

838
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:20,076
but as a woman, I certainly
like not being attacked.

839
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,544
             Where are you going
             with this, Moss?

840
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,713
     I'll tell you exactly where
     I'm going with this, Roy.

841
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:25,882
          I'm saying that we use
          this brief window

842
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:26,916
          <i> while Douglas is away</i>

843
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:29,486
         to produce
         a pepper spray solution

844
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:30,720
            for small women

845
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:32,789
            using that stuff
            I gave Roy earlier.

846
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,257
That sounds really weird.

847
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:36,759
          Jen Barber,
     not a hater of women,

848
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:39,596
      but their defender.
        Their champion.

849
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,130
I love it now.

850
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:43,967
          And I can do
    a massive presentation.

851
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,101
                  A self-defense
                  pepper spray

852
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:49,239
         for small women
         suits my purposes also.

853
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:50,907
                It'll show Alice
                that I care,

854
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:53,576
           and as a woman
           with small relatives,

855
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:56,112
          she's sure to come
          to Jen's presentation.

856
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:59,215
You know, when I first
stocked that mini-fridge

857
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:00,783
with pepper spray solution,

858
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:03,753
I thought
I'd made too much.

859
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:05,054
But only now do I realize

860
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:07,690
that I'd made exactly
the right amount

861
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,560
for our current purposes.

862
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:13,563
          It almost seems like
          it's too good an idea.

863
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:16,933
     You see what we can do
     when we work together?

864
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:18,902
   With my business acumen...

865
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:20,803
    My scientific knowhow...

866
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:23,072
              And I'm also here.

867
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,075
      We can do anything.

868
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:28,044
           All: Yeah!

869
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:31,180
    I need a trouser break.

870
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:39,355
                You coming, Roy?

871
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:43,793
      I can't seem to get
      the wording of this
     speech to Alice right.

872
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:45,061
    - You're doing a speech?
    - Yeah.

873
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,864
    I need to show her that
I'm not emotionally colorblind.

874
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:50,300
      I'm actually a very
      sensitive human man,

875
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:51,868
  and she needs to know that.

876
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:56,172
       Oh, what's a more
 romantic word for "knockers"?

877
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,275
     A more romantic word?

878
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:01,277
            Come on, guys.
            Let's protect women.

879
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:03,913
   - I'll meet you up there.
   - Good luck.

880
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,782
            Thanks.

881
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:07,584
         Eartha Kitts.

882
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,954
             Right.
      Is everything ready?

883
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:12,288
Yeah, well,
I've got the posters up,

884
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,991
and I've put gift bags
with pepper spray

885
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:15,858
              beside each chair.

886
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,026
                 I think it was
                 a master stroke

887
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:18,962
       to put the spray
       in these elegant bottles.

888
00:43:18,964 --> 00:43:21,631
      Why not look stylish
      while you defend yourself?

889
00:43:21,633 --> 00:43:23,366
Something's bothering me,
though.

890
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:28,204
    Are we missing something
     that's very obviously
     wrong with this idea?

891
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:29,672
    I really don't think so.

892
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:31,874
           Oh, look.
      Here comes everyone.

893
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,277
            Perfect.

894
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:40,149
Hello, and welcome
to this very special
presentation for women

895
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:43,219
by a woman, me,
a woman, who loves women.

896
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:44,854
<i> By your seats,</i>
<i> you'll find a gift bag.</i>

897
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:49,759
<i> And in that gift bag,</i>
<i> you'll find our</i>
<i> very exciting new product.</i>

898
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:52,762
      - No, don't do that.
      - ( screams )

899
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:53,963
         ( screaming )

900
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,833
No, no, no.
You're not supposed to--

901
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:00,737
        Yes!  I have some things
        I have to say to you.

902
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:04,240
 - I need to go.
 - No.  You are going nowhere.

903
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:06,209
     "Now, I know in the past...

904
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:10,079
  that you have accused me of
  being emotionally colorblind."

905
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:13,349
     - ( screams )
     - Shut up and listen.

906
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:15,084
          "But now I've changed.

907
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:16,219
           My sight is perfect."

908
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:19,288
   Now I know what was wrong
         with the idea.

909
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,790
      "And with your sweet lips,

910
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:23,893
            and of course
            your lovely bangers,

911
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:26,129
                I know you're
                the one for me."

912
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:28,197
I'm in terrible pain.

913
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,866
              Oh, me too, Alice.
              Me too.

914
00:44:29,868 --> 00:44:33,703
              But that ends now.
              It ends now.

915
00:44:33,705 --> 00:44:36,172
        ( crying )

916
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,445
            Well, that could not
            have gone better.

917
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:45,848
     No, no, Roy.
     That didn't go well at all.

918
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,751
   Oh, right.  Because we're
    going to lose our jobs.

919
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:50,186
         Yeah.  Sorry.

920
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:52,388
        ( screams )

921
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,357
              ( Douglas shouts )

922
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:55,425
       Jen:<i> Mr. Reynholm?</i>

923
00:44:55,427 --> 00:44:57,994
      So that's the thing.
I gave the boy the can of lager,

924
00:44:57,996 --> 00:45:00,430
   so technically I'm guilty
     of corrupting a minor.

925
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:03,900
     So it's the reason why
  I bought the tramp uniform.

926
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:06,135
    I've had to make myself
            scarce.

927
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:08,504
          So, you need somewhere
          to hide out.

928
00:45:08,506 --> 00:45:10,373
             Yeah.
      Somewhere off-piste.

929
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,008
           Somewhere where
           no one will find you?

930
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:12,975
      Bottom of the world.

931
00:45:12,977 --> 00:45:16,079
     - You can use our
       office if you like.
     - Whoa.

932
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:18,881
        Well, I'll need someone
        to take care of business
        upstairs.

933
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,450
       We're not doing anything.

934
00:45:20,452 --> 00:45:23,886
     Well, this is perfect.
     My wonderful assistant Joan

935
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:25,888
       and her two friends Ross.

936
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,225
    I'm gonna go and piss around
    on the Internet,

937
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,761
            but actually,
            I'll need some food.

938
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:34,731
        I've already eaten
        one of the toys in here.

939
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:38,334
Did he just say what
I think he said?

940
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:41,738
      I wasn't really listening.

941
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,339
           Is this...

942
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:45,108
 is what's happening good now?

943
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,810
           Is this...
         Is this good?

944
00:45:47,812 --> 00:45:49,112
                Yes, it's a very
                good outcome.

945
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:50,780
          Oh, my God.  I think
          we've come out on top.

946
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:54,784
          I can't believe it.
          We've come out on top.

  Jen:<i> Oh, I forgot about you.</i>

949
00:45:57,489 --> 00:45:59,155
Oh, God.
That's impressive.

950
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:00,356
        They're actually
          watching us.

 Silence, Small Person Racist.

953
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:09,398
     Greetings, Jen Barber.
     This is your sentence.

954
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,268
    You've been found guilty
     of the most appalling

955
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:15,171
      lack of basic human
     kindness and decency.

956

     <i> ( knocking on door )</i>

957
00:46:16,574 --> 00:46:19,308
         - Come in.

           <i> for hours.</i>

962
00:46:24,816 --> 00:46:25,848
      I'm doing something.
            Go away.

963
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:28,117
    Peter, your mother
    and I are worried about you.

964
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:30,353
      Get out of my room.
            Get out!

965
00:46:30,355 --> 00:46:31,220
                      I'm sorry.

966
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:33,322
              You need to get
              off this computer.

967
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:34,123
          No, I'm not.

968

         Who is this?
         Are these your friends?

969
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:38,227
I'm sorry,
Peter can't play anymore.

970
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:39,228
He's coming outside.
